/*
INFO:
Bitcoin Exchange, the task is to create a program that reads
a file containing historical Bitcoin prices and another file
with user input (dates and values), then calculates how much
a given amount of Bitcoin was worth on those dates.

-   For this exercise I used a map from the STL library.
    I chose map because it made sense to use a container
    with key-value pairs â€” in this case, the key is the date
    and the value is the price.
