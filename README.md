### Module 04
- Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces
    #### Subtype Polymorphism
    - Subtype polymorphism allows an object of a subclass to be treated as an object of its superclass while still maintaining its specific behavior. This enables dynamic method overriding and is commonly used in object-oriented programming (OOP).
    #### Abstract Classes
    - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly, but is meant to be used as a base class for other classes. It serves as a blueprint for other classes, providing common functionality and enforcing that derived classes implement certain methods.
    #### Interfaces in OOP
    - An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods that a class must implement. It does not provide any implementation for these methods, only the method signatures (i.e., the method name, parameters, and return type). Classes that implement an interface must provide their own implementation for all of the interface's methods.
